# Research

We constantly conduct research as part of our work. If you'd like to work with us, [get in touch.](/contact.html)

&nbsp;

## User research

Everything we do is centered around users. We have interviewed more than 300 people from 150 newsrooms in 30 countries. We've talked to frequent commenters, trolls, people who have been harassed out of the comments, and people who never comment. 

We've conducted a survey on journalism and harassment. We've brought commenters and college students into newsrooms, and community activists into universities. As a result, we've crafted user personas and aggregated needs to create our roadmap and inform our decisions.
